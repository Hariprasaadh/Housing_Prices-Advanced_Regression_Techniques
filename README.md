# Housing-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniquesüè†

This project leverages data from the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" to predict the final sale price of homes.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the sale prices of houses using the provided dataset. The main steps include:

Data Preprocessing:
1. Handling Missing Values
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training and Evaluation
4. Hyperparameter Tuning using RandomizedSearchCV
5. Final Model Selection using XGBoost

Results

The XGBoost model achieved competitive performance on the test dataset, demonstrating its ability to predict house prices accurately. Detailed results, including performance metrics and visualizations, are provided in the accompanying Jupyter notebooks.
